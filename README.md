# TatorTot Rookie Robot

This project is meant to serve as a guide by example for rookie FRC teams in
Idaho. The recommended course of learning is distinguished by the number each
directory is prefixed by and assumes no prior knowledge of robotics programming.

Should you have any questions, feel free to reach out to FRC Team 2122, Team
Tators, or in the Idaho FRC Discord server.
